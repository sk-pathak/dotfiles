# All Dotfiles for my system

- hyprPanel version -> uses agsv2/astal (written in ts, resource hungry, but easy to setup and customize)
- eww version -> uses eww (written in rust, less resource hungry, difficult to customize->uses `yuck` language)


*Note that hyprPanel version contains common configs as well like nvim,zsh,etc. If using eww, use them from hyprPanel.*

## Future plans
- automate using scripts
